        <p className='text-slate-400 text-justify px-8 md:px-48'>Any attempt to make a like-for-like comparison will reach the conclusion that they're not, at least in Western markets. Both cars and bikes cover a range from prosaic transport to luxury toy/status symbol, but in the Western world at least bikes are far more of a leisure item than day to day transport, so the bikes available here are mainly high performance models. For example, a Yamaha MT-09 - which the motorcycling press considers as a decent "budget" machine of middling ability, costs around £7500 new in the UK. It will do something around 150 mph, 0-60 in maybe 2.8 seconds. A new Ford Fiesta costs somewhere north of £10,000 for the most basic model, and is not exactly playing in the same league. Running costs will likely be about the same for both.

          The point at which the prices converge is at the bottom end of the second-hand market, but even there the comparisons are tricky. You can easily buy an old supermini with 90,000 miles on the clock that runs well enough for £500 but you will have trouble finding any motorbike at that price here other than an old moped or 125 - anything bigger at that price will probably be in need of a lot of mechanical attention. But £1000 will get you a 20-year old 600cc sports bike with 30-40,000 miles use that will still go far faster than you'd ever want to do on the road.

          I'm not really familiar with non-Western markets but in India (where I believe motorcycles outsell cars, a bit of googling suggests that you can buy a new Hero Splendor 100cc (the top seller) for around INR 45,000 (around £450 for comparison with the prices above) while the best-selling car, the Suzuki-Maruto Alto comes in at around INR 300,000 (£3000), which would buy you a pretty decent bike like a Yamaha R3.

          Do not have anyone start and idle the bike while you are gone. Idling the bike does not warm up the entire engine/transmission and driveline. This causes acids to form inside the engine as well as water vapors, which will cause corrosion over time. Those acids and water vapor burn off when you ride the bike and heat the entire system up to operating temperatures. It is not necessary to run the engine at all for that short a period of storage.</p>
